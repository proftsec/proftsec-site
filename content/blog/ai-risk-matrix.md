# Building an AI-Powered Cybersecurity Risk Matrix: From Logs to Actionable Risk Scores

## Introduction
Risk matrices are foundational to cybersecurity—helping organizations assess and prioritize threats based on **likelihood** and **impact**. But what if we could take that a step further? What if a system could **analyze raw security logs**, evaluate key attributes of an event, and **automatically score risk** without needing human triage every time?

In this blog, we'll build a lightweight simulation of an **AI-powered risk matrix engine**, using basic Python and rule-based logic (you could extend it with machine learning later). This project is perfect for cybersecurity students, professionals, and educators wanting to make **risk management concepts more tangible**.

## Why Combine AI and Risk Matrices?
While traditional risk matrices work well in static planning, today's environments are **dynamic**—logs are constantly generated, and risks shift rapidly. AI (or rule-based decision logic as a starting point) can:
- Reduce alert fatigue by scoring only high-risk events
- Standardize how risks are interpreted
- Accelerate incident response decision-making

## What We'll Build
A prototype that:
1. **Parses a simple log input** (e.g., from Wazuh or Splunk export)
2. **Extracts metadata** like asset type, event severity, source IP, etc.
3. **Evaluates likelihood and impact** using defined rules
4. **Scores each log event** and maps it to a 5x5 color-coded risk matrix

## Step 1: Understand the Risk Matrix
Here's an example of a standard 5x5 risk matrix:

| Likelihood → / Impact ↓ | Very Low | Low | Moderate | High | Critical |
|-------------------------|----------|-----|----------|------|----------|
| Rare                   | Green    | Green | Yellow   | Yellow | Orange   |
| Unlikely               | Green    | Yellow | Yellow | Orange | Red      |
| Possible               | Yellow   | Yellow | Orange | Red   | Red      |
| Likely                 | Yellow   | Orange | Red    | Red   | Red      |
| Certain                | Orange   | Red   | Red    | Red   | Red      |

We'll use logic to define how **AI logic** maps events into this grid.

## Step 2: Define Our Inputs
We'll simulate log inputs using a JSON format:
```json
{
  "event_id": "auth-fail-445",
  "severity": "high",
  "asset_type": "server",
  "asset_value": "critical",
  "source_ip": "203.0.113.24",
  "location": "external",
  "timestamp": "2025-03-18T12:43:55Z",
  "event_type": "failed_login",
  "attempts": 15
}
```

## Step 3: Build the Logic (Python Example)
We'll simulate an "AI decision engine" using rules based on the log's content.
```python
# Define scoring logic
LIKELIHOOD_MAP = {
    'attempts': [(1, 'Rare'), (5, 'Unlikely'), (10, 'Possible'), (20, 'Likely'), (float('inf'), 'Certain')]
}

IMPACT_MAP = {
    ('server', 'critical'): 'Critical',
    ('workstation', 'medium'): 'Moderate',
    ('printer', 'low'): 'Low',
    ('db', 'critical'): 'High'
}

def evaluate_likelihood(attempts):
    for threshold, rating in LIKELIHOOD_MAP['attempts']:
        if attempts <= threshold:
            return rating

def evaluate_impact(asset_type, asset_value):
    return IMPACT_MAP.get((asset_type, asset_value), 'Low')

# Risk matrix scores
RISK_MATRIX = {
    ('Rare', 'Low'): 'Green',
    ('Possible', 'Critical'): 'Red',
    ('Likely', 'High'): 'Red',
    ('Certain', 'Moderate'): 'Red',
    ('Unlikely', 'Moderate'): 'Yellow',
    # Add more entries based on your full matrix
}

# Example log
log = {
    "attempts": 15,
    "asset_type": "server",
    "asset_value": "critical"
}

likelihood = evaluate_likelihood(log['attempts'])
impact = evaluate_impact(log['asset_type'], log['asset_value'])
risk = RISK_MATRIX.get((likelihood, impact), 'Yellow')

print(f"Likelihood: {likelihood}, Impact: {impact}, Risk Score: {risk}")
```

## Step 4: Interpret the Results
In this example, 15 failed login attempts on a **critical server** triggers:
- **Likelihood:** Likely
- **Impact:** Critical
- **Risk Score:** Red (Severe)

This would signal an **urgent need for review**, alert escalation, and potential IP blocking or incident containment.

## Step 5: Expand the Use Case
- Pull real logs from Wazuh, Splunk, or Syslog
- Add natural language summaries using ChatGPT API ("This event is classified as Likely/Critical. Immediate review is advised.")
- Add a timestamp and group risk by hour/day to visualize patterns
- Extend with a Streamlit or Flask UI to drag in log files and generate a risk dashboard

## Why This Matters
This project helps:
- Reinforce understanding of **risk management principles**
- Demonstrate how **AI and automation** can reduce time-to-triage
- Provide students and teams with a **customizable framework** for risk classification

## Educational Extensions
- Instructors: turn this into a group project for evaluating system events
- Students: adapt this tool to monitor a home lab and report top 3 risks each day
- Professionals: integrate the logic into existing alerting pipelines

## Conclusion
The AI doesn’t need to be complex to be powerful. Even rule-based decision logic can make a real difference in streamlining security risk management. By turning logs into **actionable risk insights**, you build not only a useful tool—but also your own critical thinking as a cybersecurity professional.
