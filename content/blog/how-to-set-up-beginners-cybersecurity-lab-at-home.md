# How to Set Up a Beginner's Cybersecurity Lab at Home (Step-by-Step Guide)

Cybersecurity is a hands-on field, and having your own **home lab** is one of the best ways to learn. This guide will walk you through setting up a **virtual cybersecurity lab** on your computer using **free tools** like VirtualBox or VMware Player.

---

## **1️⃣ Choosing the Right Virtualization Software**
Before setting up your lab, you need a **virtualization tool** to run virtual machines (VMs). The two best free options are:

🔹 **[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)** (Open-source, beginner-friendly)  
🔹 **[VMware Workstation Player](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html)** (Better performance, requires free registration)  

📌 **Recommendation:** If you're just getting started, go with **VirtualBox** since it’s open-source and easier to configure.

---

## **2️⃣ Understanding System Requirements**
Before installing VMs, ensure your **hardware can handle virtualization**:

💻 **Minimum System Requirements:**
- **RAM:** At least **8GB** (16GB+ recommended)
- **CPU:** A **modern multi-core processor** (Intel i5/i7 or AMD Ryzen)
- **Storage:** At least **50GB of free space** (Preferably SSD)
- **Virtualization Support:** Enable **VT-x (Intel) or AMD-V** in BIOS (Check your BIOS settings)

🔍 **Check if Virtualization is Enabled (Windows):**
Open Command Prompt (`cmd.exe`) and run:
```sh
systeminfo | find "Virtualization"
```
If it says **Enabled**, you’re good to go. If not, enable it in your BIOS settings.

## **3️⃣ Installing VirtualBox / VMware Player**
### **🛠️ Installing VirtualBox**
1. **Download VirtualBox** from [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
3. Install **VirtualBox Extension Pack** for USB, webcam, and other features ([download here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)).
4. Restart your system.

### **🛠️ Installing VMware Workstation Player**
1. **Download VMware Player** from [here](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html)
2. Install it with default settings.
3. **Create a free VMware account** when prompted.
4. Restart your system.

---

## **4️⃣ Choosing Your First VM: Ubuntu or Kali Linux?**
🔹 **Ubuntu Linux (Recommended for Beginners)** – Ideal for learning Linux basics, security tools, and networking.
🔹 **Kali Linux (Advanced Users)** – Comes preloaded with hacking tools, but can be overwhelming for beginners.

📌 **Recommendation:** Start with **Ubuntu** first, then move to **Kali Linux** later.

---

## **5️⃣ Downloading & Installing Your First Virtual Machine**
### **🔹 Step 1: Download an OS ISO File**
- **Ubuntu Desktop:** [Download Here](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
- **Ubuntu Server:** [Download Here](https://ubuntu.com/download/server)
- **Kali Linux:** [Download Here](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-bare-metal)

### **🔹 Step 2: Create a New VM in VirtualBox / VMware**
1. Open **VirtualBox** or **VMware Player**.
2. Click **New** (VirtualBox) or **Create New Virtual Machine** (VMware).
3. Choose **Linux** → Select **Ubuntu (64-bit)**.
4. Allocate **RAM** (4GB minimum, 8GB recommended).
5. Create a **Virtual Hard Disk (VDI/VMDK)** → Allocate **20GB+**.
6. Attach the downloaded **ISO file** as a bootable disk.

### **🔹 Step 3: Install Ubuntu**
1. Start the VM and boot into the Ubuntu installer.
2. Select **“Install Ubuntu”**, choose keyboard settings, and proceed.
3. Use **default partitioning settings**.
4. Set up a **username & password**.
5. Complete the installation and restart the VM.

## **6️⃣ Configuring Your VM for Cybersecurity Labs**
### **📌 Essential Configurations After Installation**
- 🔹 **Enable Bidirectional Clipboard & Drag-Drop** (Settings → General → Advanced)  
- 🔹 **Set Up Network (NAT or Bridged Mode)** (Settings → Network)  
- 🔹 **Install VirtualBox Guest Additions** (for full-screen and performance improvements)  
- 🔹 **Take a Snapshot** (Backup your fresh install before making changes)  

### **🔹 Install Basic Security Tools**
Run the following commands inside your Ubuntu VM:
```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install nmap wireshark net-tools curl -y
```

📌 **Try the [Proftsec Foundational Skills Project](https://proftsec.info/projects/foundational-skills/) to test your first security tools and commands in your new lab.**

---

## **7️⃣ First Hands-On Exercises**
Now that your cybersecurity lab is set up, try these basic exercises:
✅ **Basic Linux commands:** `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `cat`, `nano`  
✅ **Check network settings:** `ip a`, `ping 8.8.8.8`, `netstat -r`  
✅ **Run an Nmap scan on your network:**
```sh
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
```
✅ **Capture network traffic with Wireshark**
✅ **Download and test Metasploitable 2 (for ethical hacking practice)**

---

## **8️⃣ Next Steps: Expanding Your Lab**
- Add a **Windows VM** for Windows security testing.
- Install **Kali Linux** for penetration testing.
- Set up **Metasploitable 2** (a vulnerable machine for practice).
- Learn **basic attack-defense exercises** (Red Team vs. Blue Team).

---

## **Final Thoughts**
Setting up a **beginner-friendly cybersecurity lab** is the first step to gaining hands-on experience. This guide helps you start small, **learn essential tools**, and **expand into more advanced setups** like Kali Linux and Windows security testing.
