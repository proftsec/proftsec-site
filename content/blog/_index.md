## Why I Created Proftsec 🛡️

Cybersecurity is evolving faster than ever, and keeping up with threats, tools, and best practices requires constant learning. As a cybersecurity educator and practitioner, I saw a gap between **theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience**—so I created **Proftsec.info** as a platform to bridge that gap.

## The Problem: A Need for Practical Cybersecurity Learning

Many cybersecurity resources are either **too theoretical** (lacking real-world application) or **too advanced** (assuming deep prior knowledge). My goal with Proftsec is to create a space that:

- **Explains cybersecurity concepts with real-world relevance.**
- **Provides hands-on labs** using open-source tools like **Burp Suite, Docker, OpenVPN, and Wazuh.**
- **Explores emerging trends** like **AI security, Zero Trust, and cloud analytics.**

## Who Is This Site For?

🔹 **Students & Cybersecurity Beginners** – Want to break into the field with hands-on skills? Start here.  
🔹 **Professionals & Security Practitioners** – Looking to deepen knowledge or try new security tools? I’ve got you covered.  
🔹 **Educators & Researchers** – Cybersecurity is always evolving; let’s learn together.  

## What You’ll Find on Proftsec
