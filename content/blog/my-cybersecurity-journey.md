# My Cybersecurity Journey: Lessons from Teaching, Consulting, and Hands-On Labs

## Introduction
My journey into cybersecurity wasn’t conventional. Before entering the field, I spent years working in various roles in **retail**, an experience that gave me a deep appreciation for **business operations and customer needs**. When I eventually returned to college as a **non-traditional student**, I started to see technology not just as a tool, but as a **critical factor in securing businesses and their data**. That realization led me down the cybersecurity path, where I combined my passion for **tinkering, problem-solving, and security** into a career.

## A Lifelong Curiosity: From Tinkering to Cybersecurity
Growing up, I was **always a tinkerer**—I wanted to understand how things worked. Ever since I was old enough to grasp electronics in the **1980s**, I was drawn to them. In the **90s**, I opened up my mom’s computer, took it apart, and rebuilt it—all without the internet to guide me! That hands-on approach to learning shaped my mindset early on. I didn’t just want to use technology; I wanted to **push its limits, break it, fix it, and understand it from the inside out.**

That curiosity naturally evolved into an interest in cybersecurity. The idea that **systems could be manipulated, secured, and optimized** fascinated me. But my time in retail also gave me a different perspective: security wasn’t just about technology—it was about **people, processes, and business continuity**. 

## Bridging the Gap Between Theory and Practice
Returning to college and studying cybersecurity confirmed what I had already suspected—**theory alone isn’t enough**. Many cybersecurity courses focus on frameworks, policies, and concepts, but without **hands-on application**, they often lack real-world impact. That’s why I was drawn to **ethical hacking**—a field that blends **technical knowledge with problem-solving and creativity**.

I’ve always loved the **oxymoron of “ethical hacking”**—where “ethical” means choosing the right path, but “hacking” is associated with breaking and destruction. It’s the perfect balance: as an **ethical hacker**, I can legally—with the right permissions—break into systems to expose weaknesses and **help companies secure their data**.

## The Evolution of My Career: Teaching, Consulting, and Labs
Over time, my cybersecurity journey took me through **three key areas:**

- **Teaching:** I found that breaking down complex security concepts into **real-world examples** helped students understand them better.
- **Consulting:** I worked with businesses, where I saw first-hand how **poor security practices** left organizations vulnerable.
- **Hands-On Labs:** Recognizing the need for experiential learning, I started developing **practical cybersecurity labs** that mirror real-world security scenarios.

Each of these experiences reinforced a simple truth: **cybersecurity must be learned by doing.**

## Looking Ahead
While my previous post on **Why I Created ProftSec** explains the mission behind the platform, this journey post is about **why I believe hands-on cybersecurity education matters.** 

- Cybersecurity is not just about reading concepts—it’s about **experimenting, failing, and learning from real-world experiences.**
- Security isn’t just an IT issue—it affects **businesses, individuals, and society at large.**
- The best cybersecurity professionals don’t just memorize frameworks—they **think like adversaries and problem-solvers.**

As I continue to build **ProftSec**, my goal is to provide a platform where **anyone—regardless of background—can gain practical cybersecurity skills**. Whether you’re a student, professional, or business owner, I hope to make cybersecurity **more accessible, practical, and engaging.**
