# Simulating ICS & Protocol Exploration

## Overview
Industrial Control Systems (ICS) rely on legacy protocols and purpose-built architectures that differ significantly from IT networks. In this project, students will simulate a basic ICS environment and examine how common protocols like Modbus and DNP3 function within it.

## What You Will Learn
- Core architecture of ICS/SCADA environments
- Functionality of Modbus and DNP3 protocols
- How ICS traffic differs from traditional IT traffic
- How to simulate and analyze ICS protocol activity in a safe environment

## Hands-On Learning
Students will gain experience using:
- **Conpot** or **ModbusPal** to simulate industrial control systems
- **Wireshark** to analyze protocol-level ICS traffic
- **Virtual network design** tools like GNS3 or VirtualBox
- Protocol interaction using **command-line tools** or scripts

ðŸ”— **Continue to the hands-on lab for full instructions!**
