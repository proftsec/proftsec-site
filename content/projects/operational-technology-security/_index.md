# OT/ICS Security (OT/SEC)

## Overview
Operational Technology (OT) and Industrial Control Systems (ICS) security is crucial for protecting critical infrastructure, such as power grids, water treatment plants, and manufacturing systems. This category introduces students to the unique security challenges in industrial environments and provides hands-on experience in securing these systems against cyber threats.

## What You Will Learn
- Fundamentals of **ICS/SCADA security** and architecture  
- Threats and vulnerabilities in industrial environments  
- Network segmentation and secure communication in OT systems  
- Hands-on experience with **Modbus, DNP3, and industrial protocols**  
- Implementing **intrusion detection and monitoring** in ICS networks  

## Why This Matters
Cyberattacks on critical infrastructure have increased, making OT/ICS security a top priority for governments and industries worldwide. Securing industrial systems ensures the reliability, availability, and safety of essential services. Understanding how ICS works and how to protect it prepares cybersecurity professionals to defend against targeted attacks.

## Hands-On Learning
Students will gain experience with:  
- **Simulating ICS environments** using tools like **Conpot** and **GNS3**  
- **Identifying vulnerabilities** in **PLC (Programmable Logic Controllers) and RTU (Remote Terminal Units)**  
- **Analyzing ICS traffic** using **Wireshark and Zeek**  
- **Implementing security controls** such as **firewalls, anomaly detection, and network segmentation**  
- **Testing real-world ICS vulnerabilities** in a controlled environment
