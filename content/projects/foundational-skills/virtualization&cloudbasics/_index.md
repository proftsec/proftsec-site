# FSC-2: Virtualization & Cloud Basics

## Overview
Understanding virtualization is essential for modern IT and cybersecurity. This project introduces students to **virtual machines (VMs), cloud computing, and containers**, helping them build the skills required to deploy and manage virtual environments.

## What You Will Learn
- Setting up virtual machines using **VirtualBox, Hyper-V, or VMware**
- Understanding **cloud computing concepts** (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Working with **containers (Docker Basics)**
- Remote access using **SSH and networking**
- Snapshotting, exporting, and restoring environments

## Self-Check: Test Your Virtualization Knowledge
