# FSC-3: Debugging, Syntax Checking, and Log Analysis

## Overview
Debugging is a **critical skill** in system administration and cybersecurity. This project will teach you **how to recognize common syntax errors, interpret error messages, analyze system logs, and implement debugging techniques** to verify the correctness of scripts and configurations.

## What You Will Learn
- **Recognizing common syntax errors** in Bash, Python, YAML, JSON, and configuration files.
- **Using logs (`/var/log/`, `journalctl`)** to troubleshoot system and application issues.
- **Applying syntax checkers** (`bash -n`, `yamllint`, `jq`, `python3 -m py_compile`).
- **Creating logging mechanisms** to track script execution and errors.
- **Automating error detection** to prevent issues before deployment.

## Self-Check: Debugging & Troubleshooting Readiness
Before proceeding to the full lab, try answering these:
1. What command lets you view authentication failures on a Linux system?
2. How can you check a Bash script for syntax errors without running it?
3. What log file stores SSH login attempts?
