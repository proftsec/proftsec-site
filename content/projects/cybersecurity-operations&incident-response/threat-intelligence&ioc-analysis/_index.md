# Threat Intelligence & IOC Analysis

## Overview
Cyber threat intelligence helps security professionals identify, track, and mitigate cyber threats. This project focuses on gathering, analyzing, and applying threat intelligence data to detect Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and improve cybersecurity defenses.

## What You Will Learn
- **Understanding Threat Intelligence** and its role in cybersecurity  
- **Collecting IOCs** from public and private sources  
- **Analyzing malicious indicators** such as IPs, domains, hashes, and URLs  
- **Using threat intelligence platforms (TIPs)** to enrich security operations  

## Hands-On Learning
Students will gain experience using:  
- **MITRE ATT&CK & AlienVault OTX** for threat intelligence analysis  
- **VirusTotal & Hybrid Analysis** for malware investigation  
- **Security logs & SIEM tools** to detect and track IOCs  
- **Threat hunting strategies** to proactively defend networks
