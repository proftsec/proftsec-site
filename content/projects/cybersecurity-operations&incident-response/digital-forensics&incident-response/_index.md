# Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR)

## **Overview**
Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR) is crucial for investigating cyber incidents, collecting digital evidence, and responding to security breaches. This project focuses on **forensic analysis techniques** to examine system artifacts, detect malicious activity, and reconstruct attack timelines.

## **What You Will Learn**
- Collecting and analyzing digital evidence
- Performing **disk and memory forensics**
- Extracting artifacts from system logs and registry files
- Investigating malware infections and insider threats
- Reconstructing attack timelines to determine root cause

## **Hands-On Learning**
Students will gain experience using:
- **Autopsy & Sleuth Kit** for disk forensics
- **Volatility & Rekall** for memory forensics
- **Plaso & log2timeline** for timeline reconstruction
- **YARA rules & IOC detection** for malware investigation

ðŸ”— **Continue to the hands-on lab for full instructions!**
