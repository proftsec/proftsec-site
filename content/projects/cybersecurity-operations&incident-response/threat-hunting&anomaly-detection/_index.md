# COIR-4: Threat Hunting & Adversary Emulation

## Overview
Threat hunting involves proactively searching for cyber threats lurking in an organizationâ€™s network before they can cause harm. This project introduces students to **threat-hunting methodologies**, **adversary simulation techniques**, and **behavioral analysis** using security data.

## What You Will Learn
- Identifying **Indicators of Attack (IOAs)** and **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)**
- Using **adversary emulation frameworks** for realistic attack simulations
- Leveraging **SIEM tools** and **endpoint detection & response (EDR)** solutions for proactive detection
- Applying **behavioral analytics and threat intelligence** in threat-hunting workflows

## Hands-On Learning
Students will gain experience using:
- **MITRE ATT&CK** & **Sigma rules** for threat detection  
- **Open-source adversary emulation tools** (CALDERA, Atomic Red Team)  
- **Threat-hunting queries** in SIEMs like Splunk, Wazuh, or Elastic Security  
- **YARA rules** for identifying malware families
