# Threat Hunting & Adversary Emulation

## Overview
Threat hunting involves proactively searching for cyber threats lurking in an organizationâ€™s network before they can cause harm. This project will introduce students to threat-hunting methodologies, adversary simulation techniques, and behavioral analysis using security data.

## What You Will Learn
- Identifying indicators of attack (IOAs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs)
- Using adversary emulation frameworks for realistic attack simulations
- Leveraging SIEM tools and endpoint detection & response (EDR) solutions for proactive detection
- Applying behavioral analytics and threat intelligence in threat-hunting workflows

## Hands-On Learning
Students will gain experience using:
- **MITRE ATT&CK & Sigma rules** for threat detection
- **Open-source adversary emulation tools** (CALDERA, Atomic Red Team)
- **Threat-hunting queries** in SIEMs like Splunk, Wazuh, or Elastic Security
- **YARA rules** for identifying malware families
