# Incident Detection with SIEM

## Overview
Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platforms play a critical role in modern cybersecurity by centralizing log collection, analyzing security events, and detecting potential threats. This project introduces students to using SIEM tools for log analysis, anomaly detection, and real-time security monitoring.

## What You Will Learn
- Collecting and analyzing security logs  
- Detecting anomalies and security threats using SIEM  
- Correlating events from multiple sources  
- Configuring alerts and dashboards for security monitoring  

## Hands-On Learning
Students will gain experience using:  
- **SIEM platforms** (Wazuh, Splunk, or ELK Stack)  
- **Log analysis tools** for detecting suspicious activity  
- **Threat intelligence feeds** for real-time security monitoring  
- **Custom alert rules** for detecting security incidents
