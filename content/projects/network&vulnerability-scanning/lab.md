# Project 6: Network & Vulnerability Scanning

## 📌 Lab Overview
In this lab, you will:
- **Use Nmap** to scan for open ports and running services.
- **Run Masscan** for high-speed scanning.
- **Detect brute-force attacks** using logs.
- **Use Metasploit auxiliary scanning** to find vulnerabilities.

## ✅ Prerequisites
You will need:
- **Debian Linux VM**
- **Windows Server VM**
- **Nmap, Masscan, Metasploit installed**

---

## 🛠 Step 1: Network Scanning with Nmap
### 1️⃣ Find the IP Address of Your Windows VM
Run the following command in your Debian Linux terminal:
```bash
ip addr
```
Example output:
```bash
192.168.1.100
```
📷 **Take a screenshot of your system’s IP address.**

### 2️⃣ Run a Basic Nmap Scan
To check which ports are open on your Windows VM, run:
```bash
sudo nmap 192.168.1.100
```
This performs a **basic scan** to detect open ports.

📷 **Take a screenshot of your scan results.**

### 3️⃣ Perform an Advanced Nmap Scan
To gather **OS and service information**, use the `-A` flag:
```bash
sudo nmap -A 192.168.1.100
```
This will:
- Detect running services
- Identify operating system details
- Check for potential vulnerabilities

📷 **Take a screenshot of your advanced Nmap scan results.**

---

## 🚀 Step 2: High-Speed Scanning with Masscan
### 1️⃣ Install Masscan (if not installed)
```bash
sudo apt install masscan -y
```

### 2️⃣ Run a Fast Network Scan
```bash
sudo masscan 192.168.1.100 --top-ports 100
```
This will:
- Scan the **top 100 most common ports**
- Provide faster results than Nmap

📷 **Take a screenshot of your Masscan results.**

---

## 🔐 Step 3: Detecting Brute-Force Attacks
### 1️⃣ Monitor Authentication Logs
View login attempts in Debian Linux:
```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/auth.log
```
Press **CTRL+C** to exit.

### 2️⃣ Check for Failed SSH Login Attempts
```bash
sudo grep "Failed password" /var/log/auth.log
```
If brute-force attempts are happening, you’ll see multiple failed logins.

📷 **Take a screenshot of detected failed login attempts.**

### 3️⃣ Install & Enable fail2ban to Block Brute-Force Attacks
```bash
sudo apt install fail2ban -y
sudo systemctl start fail2ban
sudo systemctl enable fail2ban
```
This automatically **bans IPs** that repeatedly fail login attempts.

📷 **Take a screenshot confirming fail2ban is running.**

---

## 🎯 Step 4: Metasploit Auxiliary Scanning
### 1️⃣ Start Metasploit
```bash
sudo msfconsole
```

### 2️⃣ Scan SMB Services for Open Shares
```bash
use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version
set RHOSTS 192.168.1.100
run
```
This checks for **open file shares** on Windows.

📷 **Take a screenshot of your SMB scan results.**

### 3️⃣ Scan for Known Vulnerabilities
```bash
use auxiliary/scanner/vuln/ghost
set RHOSTS 192.168.1.100
run
```
This checks if the **Ghost vulnerability** exists on the target.

📷 **Take a screenshot of any detected vulnerabilities.**

---

## 🔎 Final Check: What You Should See
By the end of this lab, you should:
✅ Have a **detailed scan report** from Nmap.  
✅ See **fast results** from Masscan.  
✅ Detect **failed login attempts** in logs.  
✅ Identify **vulnerabilities** using Metasploit.  

---

### 📷 Required Screenshots
✔ **Nmap full scan results**  
✔ **Masscan fast scan results**  
✔ **Detected brute-force attempts**  
✔ **Metasploit scanning results**  

---

### 🚀 Next Steps
- Enable logging & monitoring for network security.
- Practice writing firewall rules to block unwanted access.
- Explore advanced scanning techniques.
