# AI & ML for Threat Detection and SOC Automation

## Overview
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are revolutionizing how security teams detect, analyze, and respond to threats. This project introduces students to the fundamentals of AI and ML in cybersecurity, with a specific focus on anomaly detection and automation within Security Operations Centers (SOCs).

## What You Will Learn
- The role of AI and ML in modern cybersecurity operations
- How supervised and unsupervised ML techniques apply to threat detection
- Creating and training simple models for anomaly detection in log data
- Evaluating the performance of ML-based threat detection vs rule-based detection
- How AI supports SOC automation, alert prioritization, and triage

## Hands-On Learning
Students will gain experience using:
- **Python-based ML tools** like scikit-learn or PyCaret
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for model building and experimentation
- **Real or synthetic log datasets** to detect anomalies
- **Comparative analysis** between traditional rule-based alerts and ML-powered alerts
- **Visualization tools** to explain model outcomes and anomalies
