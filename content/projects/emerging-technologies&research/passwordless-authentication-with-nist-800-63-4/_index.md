# Implementing Passwordless Authentication with NIST 800-63-4

## Overview
The new **NIST 800-63-4 Digital Identity Guidelines** introduce a modern approach to authentication that prioritizes usability, resilience, and assurance. Organizations are encouraged to use longer passphrases, verify passwords against breached lists, and adopt passwordless methods based on **WebAuthn** and **FIDO2**.

This project provides a hands-on experience implementing passwordless authentication using **Keycloak**, mapping the setup to NIST’s **Authentication Assurance Levels (AAL2 and AAL3)**. Students will learn how modern identity systems support Zero Trust environments and reduce reliance on passwords entirely.

## What You Will Learn
- How NIST 800-63-4 redefines authentication assurance
- The role of WebAuthn and FIDO2 in passwordless identity systems
- How to configure Keycloak for passwordless authentication
- How to register and verify platform authenticators (Windows Hello, Touch ID, YubiKey)
- How passwordless methods map to AAL2 and AAL3 requirements

## Hands-On Learning
Students will gain experience using:
- **Keycloak** for identity and access management
- **WebAuthn and FIDO2** authenticators
- **Docker or local VM** Keycloak deployments
- **Windows Hello, Touch ID, or security keys** as authenticators
- **NIST assurance mapping tools** to validate authentication strength
