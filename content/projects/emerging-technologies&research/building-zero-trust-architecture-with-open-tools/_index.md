# ETR-3: Building Zero Trust Architecture with Open Tools

## Overview
Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) is a modern security model that assumes no implicit trustâ€”whether inside or outside the network perimeter. This project guides students through the principles of Zero Trust and helps them simulate a secure, identity-driven environment using open tools like pfSense, Docker, and OpenVPN.

## What You Will Learn
- Core principles of Zero Trust (least privilege, explicit verification, segmentation)
- Design patterns for ZTA and common implementation models
- Hands-on setup of segmented networks and identity-aware policies
- Integration of access control, monitoring, and secure tunneling in a Zero Trust lab

## Hands-On Learning
Students will gain experience using:
- **pfSense** for traffic segmentation and access control
- **Docker** to simulate multiple internal services and endpoints
- **OpenVPN or WireGuard** to secure connections and enforce identity checks
- **Firewall policies and IDS/IPS** to monitor East-West traffic
- **Real-world scenarios** (e.g., lateral movement prevention, just-in-time access)
