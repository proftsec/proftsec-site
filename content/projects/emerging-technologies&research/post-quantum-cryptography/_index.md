# Post-Quantum Cryptography Lab

## Overview
Quantum computing is set to transform the cybersecurity landscape by rendering many current encryption methods obsolete. This project introduces students to **post-quantum cryptography (PQC)**, including hands-on labs exploring key exchange mechanisms, digital signatures, and practical implementation challenges using leading PQC algorithms.

## What You Will Learn
- How quantum computers threaten RSA, ECC, and other classical encryption methods
- Key concepts in post-quantum cryptography, including lattice-based and hash-based algorithms
- Hands-on experience with NIST PQC candidates such as **Kyber** and **Dilithium**
- Implementation of secure key exchange and digital signatures
- Benchmarking and comparing PQC algorithms
- Preparing for a quantum-resistant future in cybersecurity

## Hands-On Learning
Students will gain experience using:
- Python and the `pqcrypto` library
- Open Quantum Safe (liboqs) and container-based testing environments
- Tools for encryption, signing, and verification
- Practical benchmarks and crypto analysis
