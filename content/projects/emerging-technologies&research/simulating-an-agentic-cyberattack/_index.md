# Simulating an Agentic Cyberattack (Reasoning-Only Lab)

## Overview
Agentic cyberattacks represent the next evolution of adversarial activity, where AI systems no longer assist attackers but *act on their own*. These systems can plan intrusion paths, adapt to defenses, generate highly targeted phishing content, and optimize their attack strategies in real time.

This project transforms the agentic attack concept into a **safe, reasoning-only simulation**. Students will guide an AI model through a realistic, multi-phase intrusion scenario against a fictional organization. The AI never executes real attacks. Instead, it explains how an autonomous adversary would think, plan, and adjust each stage of the operation.

## What You Will Learn
- The core characteristics of agentic cyberattacks
- How AI adversaries perform reconnaissance and identify technologies
- How agentic systems reason about vulnerabilities and initial access paths
- How attacker models adapt when defenses block or disrupt activity
- How agentic phishing targets specific writing styles and user behavior
- How AI-driven adversaries plan persistence, lateral movement, and attack chain optimization
- How defenders can map each phase to MITRE ATT&CK and Zero Trust strategies

## Hands-On Learning
Students will work directly with a reasoning-only AI model to explore each phase of the simulated attack:

- **Reconnaissance:** Identifying assets, technologies, and misconfigurations  
- **Vulnerability Analysis:** Evaluating potential initial access vectors  
- **Adaptive Planning:** Revising strategies based on “defender actions”  
- **Phishing Simulation:** Generating persona-based social engineering content  
- **Persistence Strategies:** Conceptual foothold development  
- **Lateral Movement:** Multi-agent decision making within internal networks  
- **Attack Chain Optimization:** Learning from SOC responses  

This lab emphasizes *understanding attacker reasoning* rather than performing technical exploitation, making it both safe and deeply relevant to modern cybersecurity operations.
