# Blockchain Security & Smart Contract Exploitation

## Overview
Blockchain technology introduces new models for decentralized trust, integrity, and data verificationâ€”but it also comes with unique vulnerabilities. This project explores blockchainâ€™s role in cybersecurity, with a focus on smart contract security, decentralized identity, and real-world exploits.

## What You Will Learn
- How blockchain enhances security through decentralization and immutability
- Common blockchain attack vectors (e.g., reentrancy, front-running, 51% attacks)
- Hands-on deployment and testing of smart contracts
- Identifying and patching vulnerabilities in smart contract code
- Use cases for blockchain in threat mitigation, identity, and secure logging

## Hands-On Learning
Students will gain experience using:
- **Ethereum testnets** with tools like Remix IDE, Ganache, or Hardhat
- **Solidity** to write and analyze smart contracts
- **Exploit simulations** based on known Web3 attacks
- **Blockchain-based logging and identity models**
