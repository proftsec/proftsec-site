# Exploit Development & Binary Exploitation

## Overview
Exploiting vulnerabilities is a key aspect of penetration testing and offensive security. This project introduces students to binary exploitation techniques, including buffer overflows, return-oriented programming (ROP), and shellcode execution. Students will learn how attackers manipulate memory to gain control over applications and how to mitigate these attacks.

## What You Will Learn
- Identifying and analyzing memory vulnerabilities
- Writing buffer overflow exploits
- Using return-oriented programming (ROP) techniques
- Crafting and executing shellcode
- Debugging and reverse engineering binaries

## Hands-On Learning
Students will gain experience using:
- **GDB & PEDA** for binary analysis and debugging
- **pwntools** for exploit development
- **Radare2 & Ghidra** for reverse engineering
- **ASLR & DEP bypass techniques**
