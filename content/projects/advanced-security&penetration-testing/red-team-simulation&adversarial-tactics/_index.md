# Red Team Simulation & Adversarial Tactics

## **Overview**
This project immerses students in **offensive cybersecurity operations** by simulating real-world cyberattacks. Participants will **emulate adversaries**, exploit vulnerabilities, escalate privileges, and move laterally across networksâ€”all while **avoiding detection**.

Understanding **red team tactics** is critical for security professionals to learn **how attackers think and operate**. This knowledge strengthens penetration testing, ethical hacking, and blue team defensive strategies.

## **What You Will Learn**
- **Gaining initial access** via social engineering, misconfigurations, and exploits  
- **Privilege escalation** using kernel exploits, misconfigured permissions, and credential theft  
- **Lateral movement** across compromised networks  
- **Defensive evasion** techniques to bypass AV/EDR solutions  
- **Simulating real-world adversaries** using MITRE ATT&CK framework  

## **Hands-On Learning**
Students will gain experience using:
- **Metasploit Framework** for exploitation & post-exploitation  
- **BloodHound & SharpHound** for Active Directory privilege escalation  
- **CrackMapExec & Mimikatz** for credential dumping and lateral movement  
- **Sliver & Covenant C2 frameworks** for adversarial simulation  
- **EDR/AV evasion techniques** using PowerShell obfuscation
