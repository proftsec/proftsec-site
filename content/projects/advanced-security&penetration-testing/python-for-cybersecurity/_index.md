# ASP-1: Python for Cybersecurity

## Overview
Python is a powerful programming language widely used in cybersecurity. From automation to vulnerability scanning, Python enables security professionals to streamline tasks and develop custom security tools. This project introduces fundamental Python scripting techniques applicable to cybersecurity.

## What You Will Learn
- Automating security tasks with Python  
- Basic scripting for reconnaissance and information gathering  
- Encoding and decoding techniques for data manipulation  
- Using Python for network scanning  

## Hands-On Learning
Students will gain experience using:  
- **Python scripting** for automation  
- **Reconnaissance tools** (WHOIS lookups, domain enumeration)  
- **Encoding techniques** (Base64, Hex, UTF-8)  
- **Basic port scanning** using Python
