# Advanced Security & Penetration Testing (ASP)

## Overview
Penetration testing and exploit development are critical components of cybersecurity. This category introduces students to offensive security techniques, ethical hacking methodologies, and security automation with Python. These projects will help students develop hands-on skills in identifying vulnerabilities, crafting exploits, and automating security assessments.

## What You Will Learn
- Advanced penetration testing techniques  
- Exploit development fundamentals  
- Web application security assessments  
- Security automation with Python  
- Red teaming tactics and methodologies  

## Why This Matters
Cybersecurity professionals must understand how attackers operate to effectively defend systems. By learning penetration testing and exploit development, students gain an in-depth understanding of security weaknesses and how to mitigate them.

## Hands-On Learning
Students will gain experience with:  
- **Metasploit Framework** for exploit development  
- **Python for security automation**  
- **Web application penetration testing** using Burp Suite & SQLMap  
- **Reverse engineering** and binary exploitation techniques
