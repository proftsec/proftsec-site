# ASP-4: Malware Analysis & Reverse Engineering

## Overview
Malware analysis is a crucial skill for cybersecurity professionals tasked with **detecting, dissecting, and mitigating malicious software**. This project introduces students to **dynamic and static analysis techniques**, including **disassembling binaries, analyzing network behavior, and reverse engineering malware** to understand its functionality.

## What You Will Learn
- **Static analysis** of malware files without execution  
- **Dynamic analysis** of malware in a controlled environment  
- **Disassembling binaries** to analyze malicious functions  
- **Extracting Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)** from malware samples  
- **Reverse-engineering techniques** to understand attack methodologies

## Hands-On Learning
Students will gain experience using:
- **Ghidra & IDA Free** for static analysis and reverse engineering  
- **Wireshark & ProcMon** to observe malware network and system behavior  
- **Hybrid Analysis & VirusTotal** for online malware scanning  
- **YARA rules** to detect and classify malware  
- **Sandboxing tools** (Cuckoo Sandbox, Any.Run) for safe execution
