# Vulnerability Assessment & Scanning

## Overview
Understanding vulnerabilities in IT systems is a critical skill in cybersecurity. This category introduces students to the fundamentals of vulnerability assessment, network scanning, and penetration testing techniques. Students will learn how to identify security flaws, analyze risk levels, and implement remediation strategies.

## What You Will Learn
- Fundamentals of vulnerability assessment and risk analysis  
- Scanning networks for open ports and exposed services  
- Identifying outdated software and misconfigurations  
- Using tools like **Nmap, Nessus, and OpenVAS** for security scanning  
- Basics of web vulnerability scanning with **Burp Suite and Nikto**  
- Interpreting and prioritizing security findings  

## Why This Matters
Security vulnerabilities pose significant threats to organizations. Cybersecurity professionals must proactively identify weaknesses before attackers can exploit them. Mastering vulnerability assessment techniques helps prevent data breaches and strengthens an organizationâ€™s security posture.

## Hands-On Learning
Students will gain experience using:  
- **Network scanning tools** (Nmap, Masscan, Zenmap)  
- **Automated vulnerability scanners** (Nessus, OpenVAS)  
- **Web security testing** (Burp Suite, Nikto)  
- **Interpreting scan results and recommending mitigation strategies**
