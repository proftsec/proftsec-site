# **VAS-1: Advanced Linux Administration & Security Lab**

## **Lab Setup**
1. **Environment**:  
   - Use **VirtualBox, Hyper-V, VMware, or a cloud-based Linux instance** (Debian, Ubuntu, or CentOS).
   - Install necessary tools:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update && sudo apt install lynis htop tmux ufw -y
     ```

2. **System Performance Monitoring**
   - Monitor real-time system performance:
     ```bash
     top
     htop
     vmstat 5 10
     ```

3. **Process & Service Management**
   - List all running services:
     ```bash
     systemctl list-units --type=service
     ```
   - Restart a failed service:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart apache2
     ```

4. **Advanced Bash Scripting**
   - Create a script to log disk space usage:
     ```bash
     #!/bin/bash
     df -h > /var/log/disk_usage.log
     ```
   - Automate it with cron:
     ```bash
     crontab -e
     ```
     Add:
     ```
     0 * * * * /home/user/disk_monitor.sh
     ```

5. **Networking & Firewall Security**
   - Check open network connections:
     ```bash
     ss -tulnp
     ```
   - Block inbound SSH (for security):
     ```bash
     sudo ufw deny 22
     ```

6. **Security Hardening**
   - Audit system security:
     ```bash
     sudo lynis audit system
     ```
   - Set strict file permissions:
     ```bash
     sudo chmod 750 /secure_data
     ```

7. **Log Analysis & Troubleshooting**
   - Find failed SSH login attempts:
     ```bash
     sudo journalctl -u sshd | grep "Failed password"
     ```
   - Monitor system logs:
     ```bash
     sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog
     ```

## **Lab Completion Tasks**
üì∏ **Screenshots Required:**
- Running performance monitoring tools (`htop`, `vmstat`).
- A custom Bash script in action.
- Network security settings (`ufw`, `iptables`).
- Results of a security audit (`Lynis`).
- Log analysis of failed logins.

üìù **Reflection Questions:**
1. What was the most difficult part of this project?
2. How do security hardening techniques help prevent attacks?
3. How can automation improve system administration?

## **Next Steps**
This lab reinforces **real-world Linux administration and security skills**. Continue exploring **server hardening, automation, and intrusion detection** to advance your expertise.
