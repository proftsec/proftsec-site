# Advanced Linux Administration & Security

## **Overview**
This project builds on **Fundamentals of Linux**, introducing **advanced administration, automation, and security techniques**. You'll explore **performance monitoring, scripting, networking, security auditing, and log analysis**, equipping you for real-world Linux system management.

## **What You Will Learn**
‚úÖ **System Performance Monitoring**: Using `top`, `htop`, `iotop`, `vmstat`, `free`  
‚úÖ **Process & Service Management**: `systemctl`, `kill`, `nohup`, `tmux`  
‚úÖ **Advanced Bash Scripting**: Automating tasks with loops, cron jobs  
‚úÖ **Networking & Firewall Security**: `iptables`, `nftables`, `ufw`, `netstat`, `ss`  
‚úÖ **Security Hardening**: Auditing with `Lynis`, configuring SELinux/AppArmor  
‚úÖ **Log Analysis & Troubleshooting**: Using `journalctl`, `syslog`, `grep`  

## **Self-Check: Are You Ready?**
Before diving into the lab, answer these:
1. How do you restart a system service?
2. What command shows real-time CPU and memory usage?
3. How can you schedule a script to run daily?
4. What firewall command would block incoming SSH?
5. How do you check failed login attempts?

üéØ If you are unsure, revisit **Fundamentals of Linux** before continuing.
