# Web Application Security & Exploitation

## **🔍 Overview**
Web applications are a **common attack target** due to their exposure to the internet. This project introduces **web security fundamentals** and teaches **ethical hacking techniques** for discovering and exploiting **SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and authentication flaws**.

Students will gain **hands-on experience** using tools like **Burp Suite, SQLMap, and OWASP ZAP** to identify and exploit web vulnerabilities.

## **🎯 What You Will Learn**
✔ **How web applications are structured and their security weaknesses**  
✔ **Performing SQL Injection (SQLi) attacks using SQLMap**  
✔ **Exploiting Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities**  
✔ **Testing authentication mechanisms and session hijacking**  
✔ **Using Burp Suite and OWASP ZAP to analyze HTTP requests**  
✔ **Web application firewall (WAF) evasion techniques**  

## **🛠️ Tools Needed**
- 🛡️ **Burp Suite Community Edition** (Intercepting & modifying web traffic)
- 🛡️ **OWASP ZAP** (Automated vulnerability scanning)
- 🛡️ **SQLMap** (SQL injection automation)
- 🛡️ **Damn Vulnerable Web App (DVWA)** or **OWASP Juice Shop** (Vulnerable environments)

## **⚡ Why This Matters**
- **Over 40% of cyberattacks** involve web application vulnerabilities.
- Many **bug bounty programs** focus on **web security exploits**.
- Understanding **web exploitation** is essential for **penetration testers, SOC analysts, and security researchers**.
