# VAS-4: Secure Web Application Development & Hardening

## Overview
Web applications are a primary target for cyberattacks. This project focuses on **secure coding practices**, **authentication mechanisms**, **web server hardening**, and **web application firewalls (WAFs)** to mitigate threats like **SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, and IDOR**.

## What You Will Learn
- Secure coding techniques to prevent common vulnerabilities
- Implementing strong authentication and session security
- Hardening web servers (Apache/Nginx) against attacks
- Using Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) for protection
- Monitoring logs and setting up security alerts

## Why This Matters
Many cyberattacks exploit weak web applications. Learning **how to secure applications from the ground up** ensures resilience against **real-world security threats**.

## Hands-On Learning
This project will include:
- **Secure coding implementation** using Python and JavaScript
- **Server hardening** by configuring Apache/Nginx securely
- **Deploying a Web Application Firewall (WAF)** for real-time protection
- **Security monitoring and logging** to detect attacks
