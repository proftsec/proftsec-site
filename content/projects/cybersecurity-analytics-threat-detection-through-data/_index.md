# Cybersecurity Analytics: Threat Detection through Data

## Overview
This section bridges traditional data analytics with cybersecurity. Focus on using data-driven approaches to analyze network logs, system events, and security alerts to pinpoint anomalies and potential threats.

## What You Will Learn
- **Data Collection for Security:** Aggregate cybersecurity data from SIEM systems, logs, and threat feeds.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Identify deviations from normal behavior that may indicate cyber intrusions.
- **Threat Intelligence Integration:** Combine internal data with external threat intelligence to boost detection accuracy.
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Develop dashboards and alert systems for ongoing security oversight.

## Why This Matters
As cyber threats evolve, integrating analytics into security operations is essential. Data-driven threat detection helps organizations respond swiftly and reduce the impact of attacks.

## Hands-On Learning
Analyze cybersecurity datasets with Python and specialized tools, build dashboards for monitoring network anomalies, and participate in simulated incident response exercises.
