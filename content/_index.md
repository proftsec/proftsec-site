# Cybersecurity That Goes Deeper Than the Certification

Most cybersecurity content teaches you to pass a test. This site teaches you to think like a practitioner.

Proftsec is built by a cybersecurity educator and program director with real-world experience in incident response, risk assessment, identity governance, and hands-on lab design. If you're a student trying to break in, a professional trying to level up, or an educator looking for practical curriculum, you're in the right place.

**11 hands-on lab tracks. 25+ original posts. One practitioner's perspective.**

## New Here? Start With These

Not sure where to begin? These are good entry points depending on where you are in your journey.

**Just starting out:**
[How to Set Up a Beginner's Cybersecurity Lab at Home](/blog/how-to-set-up-beginners-cybersecurity-lab-at-home/) and the [Foundational Skills lab track](/projects/foundational-skills/) will get you moving fast.

**Already in the field:**
[The AID-SCOPE Framework for Modern Cyber Resilience](/blog/aid-scope-framework-modern-cyber-resilience/) and the [Beyond the Firewall series](/blog/beyond-firewall-part1/) are worth your time.

**Building your career:**
The [Making Skills Visible series](/blog/invisible-skills-part1/) tackles the stuff that doesn't show up on a resume but absolutely determines who gets hired and promoted.

## Hands-On Labs and Projects

Not theory. Actual labs covering Linux fundamentals, threat intelligence, digital forensics, incident response, data analytics, and emerging tech. Built the way courses should be: with context, objectives, and real tools.

Current lab tracks include Foundational Skills, Vulnerability Assessment, Penetration Testing, Incident Response, OT/ICS Security, Emerging Technologies, and a full Data Analytics sequence from foundations through machine learning and risk management.

## The Blog

Original writing on cybersecurity topics that don't get enough coverage: why IAM alone can't solve privileged access risk, what happens to your digital identity when you die, how autonomous AI systems are reshaping the threat model. No filler, no SEO padding.

Recent posts worth reading:

- [We Secure Servers Better Than Browsers (And That's the Problem)](/blog/we-secure-servers-better-than-browsers/)

## Who This Is For

**Students entering the field:** The labs here are structured the way real jobs work. You won't just follow steps. You'll understand why each step matters. Start with the [Foundational Skills track](/projects/foundational-skills/) and build from there.

**Working professionals:** The blog tackles current threat models, governance gaps, and the career skills that actually move the needle. If you've ever felt like your technical skills outpace your visibility at work, the [Making Skills Visible series](/blog/invisible-skills-part1/) is for you.

**Educators and program directors:** The curriculum philosophy here comes from years of hands-on program development, CTF design, and real classroom experience. If you want to collaborate or exchange ideas, reach out.

## About the Creator

I'm a cybersecurity educator and program director who builds courses, runs labs, and writes about the things that actually matter in this field, including the stuff that doesn't fit neatly on a resume.

Non-traditional background. Career built in classrooms and incident rooms. Lifelong learner with a soft spot for The Legend of Zelda and a hard stance on making security education actually useful.
